      <p>In 1735, John Wesley, a well-educated Anglican priest and a leader of the “Holy Club” at Oxford, set sail for the American colonies as a missionary. During the voyage to Georgia, a violent storm struck the ship. Wesley panicked, fearing for his life. However, a group of Christian missionaries on board remained completely calm, singing hymns and praising God. Their peace came from knowing that if they survived, they would have a powerful testimony of victory in Christ Jesus—but if they perished, they would enter glory and still have victory in Him. They knew he (Jesus) is the master of the sea, Amen! 🙏 </p>

      <blockquote>Matthew 8:26 – “And he said to them, ‘Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?’ Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.” (ESV)</blockquote>

      <p>Wesley was shaken by the missionaries’ unshakable faith, realizing that despite all his theological knowledge and religious devotion, he lacked their assurance of salvation. This moment forced him to question his own faith. </p>

      <blockquote>Matthew 7:21-23 – “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.” (ESV)</blockquote>

      <p>After returning to England, Wesley sought spiritual guidance from the church of the missionaries. Then, in 1738, at a meeting on Aldersgate Street, he experienced a deep spiritual awakening, famously saying, “I felt my heart strangely warmed.” This moment became a turning point in his life, ultimately leading to the Methodist Revival.</p>

      <blockquote>Ephesians 2:8-9 – “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.” (ESV)</blockquote>

      <h2>The Point:</h2>

      <p>Without true faith—the kind those missionaries had—it is impossible to please God. You can have all the theological knowledge in the world, but let me give you a reality check: if perfect theology were a requirement for entering glory, we’d all be in big trouble.</p>

      <blockquote>Hebrews 11:6 – “And without faith it is impossible to please God, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.” (ESV)</blockquote>

      <h2>For Full Disclosure:</h2>

      <p>I do not endorse every sect of people who profess “Jesus”, because, as I’ve said many times before:
“Not everyone’s Jesus is my Jesus.”</p>
