<p class="yellow">Heavenly Father,</p>
<p class="blue">You are the Creator of all things, and in Your wisdom, You have formed each child fearfully and wonderfully.</p>
<p class="red">I lift up this precious child to You— A beautiful soul, uniquely made in Your image, with a purpose that only You fully understand.</p>
<p class="yellow">Lord Jesus, You who welcomed the little children and laid Your hands upon them, Please place Your healing, comforting hand upon this child.</p>
<p class="blue">Touch their heart, their mind, their body, and their spirit. Where there is frustration, bring peace. Where there is confusion, bring clarity.</p>
<p class="red">Where there is silence, bring joyful expression. Where there is struggle, bring strength.</p>
<p class="yellow">Holy Spirit, be present in our home and in our hearts. Give us patience, wisdom, and endurance.</p>
<p class="blue">Help us to love as You love—unconditionally and with joy.</p>
<p class="red">Guide teachers, therapists, doctors, and caregivers to be instruments of Your grace. Surround our child with compassion, understanding, and protection.</p>
<p class="yellow">May this child know deeply that they are not broken or forgotten—</p>
<p class="blue">They are cherished, seen, and held by You.</p>
<p class="red">May their life shine with Your glory in ways we cannot yet see.</p>
<p class="yellow">In the name of the Father,</p>
<p class="blue">and of the Son</p>
<p class="red">and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.</p>
