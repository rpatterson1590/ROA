    <h3>The Orthodox Study Bible, Hardcover: Ancient Christianity Speaks to Today's World</h3>
    <p><em>By St. Athanasius Academy of Orthodox Theology</em></p>
    <div class="stars">★★★★★</div>
    <p>The FIRST EVER Orthodox Study Bible presents the Bible of the early church and the church of the early Bible.</p>
    <p>The Orthodox Study Bible is a rich and reverent resource that brings the timeless wisdom of ancient Christianity into today’s world. Drawing from the Septuagint for the Old Testament and rooted deeply in the patristic tradition, this study Bible offers insight not just into Scripture, but into how the earliest Christians understood and lived it. The commentary, notes, and introductions are saturated with the voices of the Church Fathers, offering theological depth that stays faithful to historic Christian doctrine. With its liturgical reverence, sacramental focus, and Christ-centered interpretation, this is more than just a study tool—it’s a spiritual companion. For those seeking the fullness of the faith as preserved in the early Church, this is a must-have. It’s my favorite study Bible for a reason.</p>

    <h3>The Apostolic Fathers: A New Translation (Lexham Classics)</h3>
    <p><em>by Rick Brannan</em></p>
    <div class="stars">★★★★★</div>
    <p>The Apostolic Fathers: A New Translation (Lexham Classics) offers a fresh, accessible, and faithful rendering of some of the earliest Christian writings outside the New Testament. Including works like 1 & 2 Clement, The Didache, Ignatius of Antioch’s letters, Polycarp, and The Shepherd of Hermas, this volume gives modern readers a direct line to the theology, worship, and church structure of the post-apostolic era. The translation is clear without sacrificing depth, and the footnotes provide helpful context without overwhelming the reader. For anyone looking to understand how the earliest Christians interpreted Scripture, practiced the faith, and defended truth, this is a must-have resource. It's an ideal bridge between the New Testament and the formal development of early Church doctrine.</p>

    <h3>Against Heresies</h3>
    <p><em>by St. Irenaeus</em></p>
    <div class="stars">★★★★★</div>
    <p>The five books of Against Heresies by St. Irenaeus of Lyons are a monumental defense of apostolic Christianity against the rising tide of Gnosticism in the 2nd century. Written with pastoral urgency and theological precision, Irenaeus not only exposes the absurdities and contradictions of heretical teachings, but also systematically presents the faith handed down from the apostles through the Church. His deep commitment to Scripture, the authority of apostolic succession, and the unity of the Old and New Testaments makes this work a cornerstone of early Christian theology. For anyone serious about understanding how the early Church preserved doctrinal truth, Against Heresies is essential reading—both as a historical witness and a timeless guide in defending the faith.</p>

    <h3>Rock and Sand: An Orthodox Appraisal of the Protestant Reformers and Their Teachings</h3>
    <p><em>Archpriest Josiah B. Trenham</em></p>
    <div class="stars">★★★★☆</div>
    <p>In Rock and Sand: An Orthodox Appraisal of the Protestant Reformers and Their Teachings, Fr. Josiah Trenham offers a thorough, respectful, yet unapologetically Orthodox critique of the Protestant Reformation and its theological legacy. Drawing on the teachings of the early Church and the unbroken tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy, Trenham examines the major Reformers—Luther, Calvin, Zwingli—and contrasts their innovations with the historic faith of the first millennium. What sets this book apart is its tone of clarity without hostility; it neither demonizes the Reformers nor compromises Orthodox convictions. Instead, it invites readers into a deeper consideration of what was lost in the West and preserved in the East. Rock and Sand is a compelling read for Protestants, Orthodox, and seekers alike who are serious about truth and Church history.</p>

    <h3>The White Lie</h3>
    <p><em>by Walter T. Rea</em></p>
    <div class="stars">★★★★☆</div>
    <p>In The White Lie, former Seventh-day Adventist pastor Walter T. Rea delivers a bold and controversial exposé on Ellen G. White, the prophetic figure at the heart of Adventism. With detailed research and firsthand access to unpublished materials, Rea reveals that large portions of White’s writings—once claimed to be divinely inspired—were actually plagiarized from other Christian authors of her time. The book challenges the foundation of her prophetic authority and raises serious theological and ethical questions for anyone within or investigating the SDA movement. Whether you agree with all of Rea’s conclusions or not, The White Lie forces readers to confront the uncomfortable gap between claimed inspiration and historical fact.</p>

    <h3>The Case for Christ</h3>
    <p><em>by Lee Strobel</em></p>
    <div class="stars">★★★★☆</div>
    <p>A former atheist journalist investigates the evidence for Jesus' resurrection and divinity.</p>
    <p>I love this book—it's one I bring up every time I share my testimony.
The audiobook version, along with Is God a Moral Monster by Paul Copan, absolutely broke me and played a huge role in helping me turn to God. Lee Strobel's journey from atheism to faith mirrored so much of what I was wrestling with. His methodical, investigative style made the evidence for Jesus impossible to ignore.
The movie adaptation hit just as hard—it brought both me and my wife to tears. Seeing his transformation unfold on screen was a powerful reminder that God can reach anyone, even the most skeptical minds.
This book isn’t just apologetics—it’s personal. It’s a story of redemption, reason, and relentless pursuit of truth. If you or someone you know is struggling with doubt, The Case for Christ is the first book I’d put in their hands.</p>

    <h3>Is God a Moral Monster?: Making Sense of the Old Testament God</h3>
    <p><em>by Paul Copan</em></p>
    <div class="stars">★★★★☆</div>
    <p>In this timely and readable book, apologist Paul Copan takes on some of the most vexing accusations of our time.</p>
    <p>In Is God a Moral Monster?, Paul Copan tackles some of the toughest accusations against the Old Testament—claims that God is genocidal, misogynistic, or morally inconsistent. With careful scholarship and accessible language, Copan dismantles these arguments by placing ancient laws and events in their proper cultural and historical context. He shows that many so-called moral horrors were actually radical moral improvements for their time and that God was patiently moving humanity toward a higher ethic fulfilled in Christ. While not every answer will satisfy emotionally, Copan delivers a powerful defense of God’s justice, goodness, and consistency from Genesis to Revelation.</p>

    <h3>Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus: A Devout Muslim Encounters Christianity</h3>
    <p><em>by Nabeel Qureshi</em></p>
    <div class="stars">★★★★☆</div>
    <p>In Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus, Nabeel Qureshi shares his powerful and deeply personal journey from devout Islam to faith in Jesus Christ. Written with sincerity, intellectual rigor, and emotional honesty, Qureshi walks readers through the theological, historical, and relational struggles he faced as he wrestled with the claims of Christianity. What makes this book stand out is its balance of apologetics and testimony—it’s both a defense of the gospel and a vulnerable story of costly discipleship. Qureshi’s love for his Muslim family and his unwavering pursuit of truth make this a compelling read for anyone interested in Christian-Muslim dialogue, apologetics, or the transformative power of encountering Christ.</p>
