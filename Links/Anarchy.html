      <p class="post-meta">Posted on September 11, 2025 • Category: Apologetics</p>

<img src="Anarchy.png" class="post-image">

<p>To borrow a phrase from <a href="https://saintkosmas.org/about-fr-josiah-trenham">Fr. Josiah B. Trenham</a> — the 1960s and 1970s were known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution">"The Sexual Revolution"</a> But today, we no longer live in a revolution — we live in an age of “Sexual Anarchy.” </p>

<p>Scripture and the Church Fathers are clear: sexual sin is not merely a physical act, it is spiritual slavery.</p>

<p>Paul says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206%3A16&version=NASB">Romans 6:16</a> that “whoever you obey becomes your master — whether sin leading to death or obedience leading to righteousness." <a href="https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> warns that the soul that fornicates "plays with demons,” showing that sexual sin is not morally neutral — it is participation with darkness.</p>

<p>When we persist in sexual perversion, we place ourselves under demonic dominion — a counterfeit lordship. Just as confession and obedience to Christ makes Him your Master, so ongoing obedience to sin enslaves you under the power of darkness. This boundage must be broken through repentance, prayer, and deliverance so that Christ may reign as Lord over every part of our lives.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A27&version=NASB">Genesis 1:27</a> tells us that humanity was created in the image of God — male and female. No other part of creation bears this unique image. God even affirmed the dignity of humanity by taking on a human body in Jesus Christ to restore what was broken.</p>

<p>When we live contrary to God’s design, we distort His image — and this is precisely what the devil delights in. We often confuse ‘human nature’ with sin, selfishness, and brokenness, but that is fallen nature. God declared His creation “very good” (Genesis 1:31), so true human nature was originally pure and obedient. Sin corrupted this nature, but Christ came to restore it so we can once again live as His image-bearers.</p>

<p>I know my beloved Protestant brothers and sisters are not typically known for practicing formal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechism">catechism</a> like our Catholic and Orthodox brethren. But as Fr. Josiah B. Trenham warns in the video linked below, when we neglect to teach our children the faith, we allow the secular world — and ultimately Satan — to catechize them instead. To raise a child in a secularized way is to do them a tragic disservice, handing them over to the confusion and perversion of this age rather than grounding them in the truth of Christ.</p>

<h2>📖 Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
 <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206%3A16&version=NASB">Romans 6:16</a> — “Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?” 
</blockquote>
<p><small>Directly supports that obeying sin is slavery, obeying Christ is mastership.</small></p>

<blockquote class="warning"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A34&version=NASB">John 8:34</a> — “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin.”</blockquote>
<p><small>Confirms that sin—even habitual or sexual sin—results in spiritual bondage.</small></p>

<blockquote><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206%3A15-16%2C%2018-20&version=NASB">1 Corinthians 6:15-16, 18-20</a> — Sexual immorality unites the believer's body to sin, it’s dishonoring the temple of the Holy Spirit.</blockquote>
<p><small>Supports that sexual sin isn't just physical, but deeply spiritual, affecting identity and holiness.</small></p>


<blockquote><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A27%2C%201%3A31&version=NASB">Genesis 1:27, 1:31</a> — “So God created man in his own image … male and female he created them”; “God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.”</blockquote>
<p><small>Affirms human nature was made good, image-bearing, and that true nature was pure before corruption.</small></p>

<h2>🏛 Church Father</h2>

<blockquote>“When you yield yourself to sin, you deliver yourself up to a tyrant and are bound like a slave.”- <a href="https://orthodoxwiki.org/John_Chrysostom">St. John Chrysostom</a></blockquote>
<p><smal>Chrysostom uses “slave,” “tyrant,” and “bound”—precisely your language of spiritual slavery and dominion.</smal></p>

<blockquote>“God became man so that man might become god.”- <a href="https://orthodoxwiki.org/Athanasius_of_Alexandria">St. Athanasius</a> (On the Incarnation)</blockquote>
<p><small>This underlines that Christ took on human nature in order to restore it—to remake us as image-bearers again. Emphasis on restoration of true human nature.</small></p>

<blockquote>“Sin is a voluntary servitude that brings the soul under the dominion of the devil.”- <a href="https://orthodoxwiki.org/Basil_the_Great">St. Basil the Great</a></blockquote>
<p><small>Echoes “counterfeit lordship”: sin as servitude, demonic dominion, voluntary surrender.</small></p>

<blockquote>“Whoever does not voluntarily withdraw himself from the causes of the passions is involuntarily drawn away by sin.”- <a href="https://orthodoxwiki.org/Isaac_of_Syria">St. Isaac of Syria</a> (Ascetical Homilies)</blockquote>
<p><small>Relates neglecting teaching or resisting leads children into moral chaos—passions, sin, bondage.</small></p>
