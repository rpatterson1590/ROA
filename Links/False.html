      <img class="post-image" src="false2.png">

      <h1>📜 Biblical Standard</h1>

<div class="bible">
<h3>Old Testament</h3>

<blockquote>If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder comes true, concerning which he spoke to you, saying, ‘Let us walk after other gods (whom you have not known) and let us serve them,’  you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for Yahweh your God is testing you to find out if you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul.-<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2013%3A1%E2%80%933&version=LSB">Deuteronomy 13:1–3</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in My name which I have not commanded him to speak, or which he speaks in the name of other gods, [a]that prophet shall die.’  Now [b]you may say in your heart, ‘How will we know the word which Yahweh has not spoken?’ When a prophet speaks in the name of Yahweh, if the thing does not come about or come true, that is the thing which Yahweh has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him.-<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2018%3A20%E2%80%9322&version=LSB">Deuteronomy 18:20–22</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>Then Yahweh said to me, “The prophets are prophesying lies in My name. I have neither sent them nor commanded them nor spoken to them; they are prophesying to you a vision of lies, divination, futility, and the deception of their own hearts.-<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2014%3A14&version=LSB">Jeremiah 14:14</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>“Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you. They are leading you into vanity; They speak a vision of their own heart, Not from the mouth of Yahweh.-<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2023%3A16&version=LSB">Jeremiah 23:16</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy from their own heart, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh! Thus says Lord Yahweh, “Woe to the wickedly foolish prophets who are walking after their own spirit and have seen nothing.-<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2013%3A2%E2%80%933&version=LSB">Ezekiel 13:2–3</a></blockquote>
<blockquote>And it will be that if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, ‘You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of Yahweh’; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies.-<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah%2013%3A3&version=LSB">Zechariah 13:3</a></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="bible">
  <h3>New Testament</h3>
  <blockquote>“Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.  You will [a]know them by their fruits. [b]Are grapes gathered from thorn bushes or figs from thistles?-<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207%3A15%E2%80%9316&version=LSB">Matthew 7:15–16</a></blockquote>
  <blockquote>Many false prophets will arise and will deceive many.-<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024%3A11&version=LSB">Matthew 24:11</a></blockquote>
  <blockquote>For false christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders, so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect.-<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024%3A24&version=LSB">Matthew 24:24</a></blockquote>
  <blockquote>But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will also be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.-<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%202%3A1&version=LSB">2 Peter 2:1</a></blockquote>
  <blockquote>Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.-<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204%3A1&version=LSB">1 John 4:1</a></blockquote>
  <blockquote>And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the presence of men. And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which were given to him to do [a]in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who *had the wound of the sword and has come to life.-<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2013%3A13%E2%80%9314&version=LSB">Revelation 13:13–14</a></blockquote>
  <blockquote>And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who did the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone.-<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2019%3A20&version=LSB">Revelation 19:20</a></blockquote>

<div>
 <h3>⚔️ What the Early Church Fathers Said About False Prophets</h3>
<h4>Didache (c. 1st century)</h4>
  <p>The <em>Didache</em>, the earliest Christian manual after the New Testament, hits hard:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “Not everyone who speaks in the Spirit is a prophet, but only if he has the ways of the Lord. So by their behavior will the false prophet and the true prophet be known.”
    <span>— Didache, Ch. 11</span>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    “If he says in the Spirit, 'Give me money,' he is a false prophet.”
  </blockquote>
  <div><strong>Key Warning:</strong> False prophets use spiritual gifts for personal gain. Their lifestyle will expose them.</div>

 <h4>Irenaeus (c. 130–202 AD)</h4>
  <p>In <em>Against Heresies</em>, Irenaeus warns sharply about deception:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “Error, indeed, is never set forth in its naked deformity... but it is craftily decked out... that the inexperienced may be led to believe falsehood for the truth.”
    <span>— Against Heresies, Book I, Preface</span>
  </blockquote>
  <p>He targets Gnostics, false apostles, and self-proclaimed prophets who distort Scripture and Christ's nature.</p>

  <h4>Justin Martyr (c. 100–165 AD)</h4>
  <p>Justin, in his <em>Dialogue with Trypho</em>, warns that false teachers twist Scripture and lead people away from Christ.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “Many spirits are abroad in the world, and the credentials they display are splendid... but we must test them to see if they confess Jesus Christ.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>He emphasized discernment through apostolic teaching and Scripture, not charisma or visions.</p>

  <h4>Tertullian (c. 160–225 AD)</h4>
  <p>Tertullian condemned Montanus, a heretical prophet who claimed direct divine inspiration and new revelation.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “The Lord sent the Holy Spirit, not to teach new doctrine, but to recall what had already been taught.”
    <span>— On the Prescription of Heretics, Ch. 9</span>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Tertullian exposes new revelations that contradict apostolic truth as false prophecy.</p>

  <h4>Origen (c. 184–253 AD)</h4>
  <p>Origen warned that Satan disguises his workers as prophets, just as Paul said in 2 Corinthians 11.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “Just as Christ had true prophets, so too does the devil have his own false prophets.”
    <span>— Homilies on Matthew, 10.4</span>
  </blockquote>
  <p>He emphasized biblical testing and the danger of being misled by emotionalism or supernatural displays.</p>

  <h4>Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 260–340 AD)</h4>
  <p>In his <em>Church History</em>, Eusebius documents how the early church publicly refuted and excommunicated false prophets—especially those tied to Gnostic sects and Montanists.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “So many were the false prophets... who dared to lie in the name of the Holy Spirit.”
  </blockquote>

<img class="post-image" src="Miller.png">

      <h2>William Miller (1782–1849)</h2>

      <p>Miller was a Baptist preacher and founder of the Millerite movement, a major 19th-century American religious movement that predicted the Second Coming of Jesus Christ</p>
      <p>A former Deist turned Christian after his experiences in the War of 1812</p>
      <p>Self-taught Bible student who focused heavily on Daniel 8:14</p>
      <p>Concluded through his calculations that Christ would return between 1843 and 1844</p>

      </ul>

      <h2>❌ William Miller's False Prophecies</h2>

      <h4>Jesus Will Return Between March 21, 1843 – March 21, 1844</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Claim: Based on his interpretation of Daniel 8:14 (“2,300 days”), Miller said these symbolized 2,300 years, ending around 1843.</li>
        <li>Result: Christ did not return.</li>
        <li>Miller’s Response: Claimed he misunderstood the calendar but still expected Christ’s return “soon.”</li>
      </ul>
      

      <h4>Jesus Will Return on October 22, 1844</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: After the first failure, Millerites reinterpreted the end date using the Jewish Day of Atonement (10th day of the 7th month, 1844) → Oct. 22, 1844.</li>
  <li>Promoted by: Samuel S. Snow (but Miller endorsed it).</li>
  <li>Result: No return of Christ. This triggered the “Great Disappointment.”</li>
</ul>


      <h4>The World Would Be Cleansed by Fire in 1844</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: Miller taught that the “cleansing of the sanctuary” in Daniel 8:14 referred to the cleansing of the Earth by fire—i.e., Christ's return to destroy the wicked.</li>
  <li>Result: The Earth was not burned, and no divine judgment came in 1844.</li>
  </ul>


      <h4>All Who Reject the 1844 Message Are Lost</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: Some within the movement, including Miller’s close associates, believed (and implied Miller agreed) that rejecting the 1844 message = spiritual ruin.</li>
  <li>Result: Many devout Christians rejected the date but remained faithful to Christ.</li>
 </ul>


      <h4>Affirmed God’s Hand Was in the Specific Date</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Quote: “I believe the time, I have preached, that Christ will come… is correct.”</li>
  <li>Result: He later admitted he was wrong, but never fully retracted the prophetic claim itself—he only regretted the outcome.</li>
</ul>



<img class="post-image" src="Russell.png">

     <h2>Charles T. Russell (1852–1916)</h2>

      <p>An American religious leader and founder of the Bible Student movement, which later evolved into the Jehovah’s Witnesses under Joseph Rutherford.</p>
      <p>Denied the Trinity, the bodily resurrection of Christ, and the existence of Hell as eternal punishment.</p>
      <p>Claimed Christ returned invisibly in 1874 and that Armageddon would occur in 1914.</p>
      <p>Claimed reading his books was more important than reading the Bible alone.</p>

      <h2>❌ List of Failed Prophecies by Charles T. Russell</h2>

      <h4>Christ’s Invisible Return in 1874</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: Jesus Christ returned invisibly in 1874 and began ruling spiritually.</li>
  <li>Source: Studies in the Scriptures, Vol. 2, The Time is at Hand (1889)</li>
  <li>Reality: No biblical or historical evidence of Christ's return in 1874.</li>
  <li>Later Action: The Watchtower shifted the date to 1914 under Rutherford.

</li>
</ul>

      <h4>The Resurrection of the Saints in 1878</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: The “faithful dead” (including apostles) were resurrected in 1878.</li>
  <li>Source: Studies in the Scriptures, Vol. 3</li>
  <li>Reality: No such event occurred. Totally unverifiable.</li>
  <li>Result: Quietly dropped by later JW leadership.
</li>
</ul>

      <h4>Armageddon and End of the “Gentile Times” in 1914</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: The world would end in 1914, human governments would be destroyed, and Christ's kingdom would fully take over.</li>
  <li>Source: Zion’s Watch Tower, July 15, 1894
    <blockquote>“...the battle of the great day of God Almighty... will end in A.D. 1914 with the complete overthrow of earth’s present rulership.”</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Reality: 1914 came and went. World War I began, but human governments remained. No millennial reign. No resurrection.</li>
</ul>


      <h4>Complete Destruction of Churches and Kingdoms by 1918</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: By 1918, God would destroy all false churches and political institutions.</li>
  <li>Source: The Finished Mystery (published posthumously, 1917)
    <blockquote>“In the year 1918, when God destroys the churches wholesale... many will perish.”</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Reality: No such destruction happened. Churches remained. The world moved on.</li>
</ul>


      <h4>Final End in 1925 (Carried by His Followers)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Though Russell died in 1916, his successor, Joseph Rutherford, continued Russell's prophetic structure and predicted:
    <blockquote>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob would return physically in 1925.</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Reality: Obviously false. No patriarchs returned.</li>
  <li>Shows that the movement Russell built continued propagating false timelines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>❌ False Prophecies and Errors of Ellen G. White</h2>

<h4>Christ’s Return Was Imminent for Her Generation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: Some present at a church conference would live to see Jesus return.
    <blockquote>“Some are food for worms, some are subjects of the seven last plagues, some will be alive and remain upon the earth to be translated at the coming of Jesus.”
— Testimonies for the Church, Vol. 1, p. 131</blockquote>
  </li>

<ul>
  <li>Claim:

  <li>Reality: Modern Jerusalem is rebuilt, thriving, and globally significant.</li>
</ul>

<h4>England Would Declare War on the U.S.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim:
    <blockquote>“When England does declare war, all nations will have an interest of their own to serve, and there will be general war...”
— Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 259</blockquote>
  </li>
<li>Reality: England never declared war on the United States. No such “general war” occurred as described.</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Atonement Was Not Completed at the Cross</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: Jesus only began the atonement in 1844.<blockquote>“Now while our great High Priest is making the atonement for us...”
— The Great Controversy, p. 480</blockquote></li>
<li>Contradiction:<blockquote>“It is finished.” — Jesus (John 19:30)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“By one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.” — Hebrews 10:14
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<h4>Satan Bears the Sins of Believers</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Claim: Satan is the final sin-bearer (scapegoat).<blockquote>“Satan... bears the final penalty of sin.”
— The Great Controversy, p. 422</blockquote></li>
    <li>Biblical Error: Only Christ bears sin (Isaiah 53:5–6; 1 Peter 2:24)</li>
  </ul>

<h4>Meat-Eaters Can’t Be Saved</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim:<blockquote>“Those who use flesh meats freely... will not be translated.”
— Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 380</blockquote></li>
  <li>Biblical Refutation: Jesus ate fish (Luke 24:42), Paul allows all food with thanksgiving (1 Tim. 4:1–5)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Enoch Lives on Saturn (or a Planet with Seven Moons)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: Vision of a planet with large beings and Enoch residing there.
— Early Writings, pp. 39–40</li>
  <li>Problem: Pure speculation. No scriptural or scientific basis.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Direct Divine Inspiration — Yet Heavy Plagiarism</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: Her visions and books were from God.</li>
  <li>Reality: 30–90% of her works were copied from earlier authors, including Protestant writers and health reformers.<blockquote>Exposed by SDA scholar Walter Rea in The White Lie.</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<h4>Affirmed the Failed 1844 Prophecy</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: The 1844 date (Miller's Great Disappointment) was still divinely guided.</li>
  <li>Reality: Christ did not return or begin any visible prophetic work in 1844. She just redefined it as the “start of the investigative judgment.”</li>
</ul>

<img class="post-image" src="Smith.png">
<h2>Joseph Smith (1805–1844)</h2>

<p>Born in Vermont, claimed his first vision at age 14</p>
<p>Founded the Mormon movement in 1830 with the publication of the Book of Mormon</p>
<p>Claimed to be God’s modern prophet restoring the true church</p>
<p>Taught that true Christianity was lost after the apostles, and only restored through him</p>

<h2>❌ False Prophecies and Errors of Joseph Smith</h2>

<h4>Christ’s Return by 1891</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Prophecy: Jesus would return within 56 years (i.e., by 1891).</li>

— History of the Church, Vol. 2, p. 182 (Feb. 14, 1835)</blockquote>
</li>
    <li>Result: Christ did not return.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Temple in Independence, Missouri, in His Generation</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Prophecy: A temple would be built in Missouri during the lifetime of those alive in 1832.</li>
   <li>Quote: <blockquote>“...a house shall be built... in the generation of that people.”
— Doctrine & Covenants 84:2–5 (Sept. 1832)</blockquote></li>
    <li>Result: No temple was built. That generation died.</li>
  </ul>


 <h4>U.S. Government Overthrown Shortly</h4> 
<ul>
  <li>Prophecy: The U.S. would be “utterly overthrown and wasted” in a few years.</li>
   <li>Quote: <blockquote>“...the government will be utterly overthrown and wasted, and there will not be so much as a potsherd left.”
— History of the Church, Vol. 5, p. 394 (Dec. 25, 1832)</blockquote></li>
    <li>Result: The U.S. still stands nearly 200 years later.</li>
     
</ul>


<h4>Civil War Would Spread Globally</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Prophecy: The American Civil War would expand into a global war.</li>
   <li>Quote: <blockquote>“...war will be poured out upon all nations...”

  <h4>New York Will Be Destroyed If They Reject the Book of Mormon</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Prophecy: Cities including New York would be destroyed.</li>

    <li>Result: New York rejected it. Still thriving.</li>
   </ul>

  <h4>David W. Patten Will Go on a Mission in Spring 1839</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Prophecy: Apostle David Patten would go on a mission “next spring.”</li>
   <li>Quote: <blockquote>“...my servant David W. Patten may perform a mission... next spring.”
— D&C 114:1 (April 1838)</blockquote></li>

— D&C 100:13–17</blockquote></li>
    <li>Result: Zion was not redeemed, and no temple was ever built.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>All Nations Would Bow to LDS Theocracy</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Prophecy: The Kingdom of God (through the LDS church) would consume all other nations.</li>
   <li>Quote: <blockquote>“...the kingdom of God shall roll forth... and break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms.”
— D&C 65:5–6</blockquote></li>

<img class="post-image" src="Eddy.png">
<h2>Mary Baker Eddy (1821–1910)</h2>

<p>Born in New Hampshire in 1821</p>
<p>Claimed to be divinely inspired after recovering from an injury in 1866</p>
<p>Founded Christian Science in 1879, claiming to restore “primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing”</p>
<p>Wrote Science and Health, treated as Scripture by her followers</p>

<h2>❌ False Prophecies & Failed Predictions of Mary Baker Eddy</h2>

<h4>Death Will Be Overcome Through Christian Science</h4>
<ul>
<li>Claim: Death is “not real,” just a belief, and will be overcome by right understanding of Christian Science.</li>
<li>Quote:<blockquote>“The relinquishment of all faith in death and also of the fear of its sting would raise the standard of health and morals... and destroy this last enemy.”
— Science and Health, p. 426</blockquote></li>
<p>Reality:</p>
<li>Eddy died in 1910 at age 89.</li>
<li>Every Christian Scientist since has also died.</li>
<li>1 Corinthians 15:26 says death is the “last enemy” to be destroyed by Christ’s return, not by metaphysical thought.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Her Church Would Fill the Earth</h4>
<ul>
<li>Claim: Christian Science would become globally dominant, reforming the world’s spiritual and physical condition.</li>
<li>Quote:<blockquote>“This [Christian Science] will establish the kingdom of heaven on the earth.”
— Miscellaneous Writings, p. 174</blockquote></li>
<p>Reality:</p>
<li>Christian Science peaked in the 1930s, with ~1,200 churches in the U.S.</li>
<li>Now in rapid decline — fewer than 400 congregations remain.</li>
<li>It's considered a fringe sect with dwindling influence.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Christian Science Would Make Medicine Obsolete</h4>
<ul>
<li>Claim: Spiritual healing would replace medicine, surgery, and doctors.</li>
<li>Quote:<blockquote>“The time for thinkers has come... and the present demand is for metaphysics...”
— Science and Health, Preface</blockquote>
<blockquote>“You must abandon all trust in matter and employ Mind alone.”
— Science and Health, p. 144</blockquote></li>
<p>Reality:</p>
<li>Countless followers suffered or died avoiding medical care.</li>
<li>Christian Scientists eventually began seeking medical treatment quietly, contradicting the original claim.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sin Is Not Real — and Will Disappear</h4>
<ul>
<li>Claim: Sin is an illusion of mortal mind and will be eliminated through understanding.</li>
<li>Quote:<blockquote>“Man is incapable of sin... sin is unreal and does not belong to the spiritual man.”
— Science and Health, pp. 475–482</blockquote></li>
<p>Reality:</p>
<li>Romans 3:23 – “All have sinned.”</li>
<li>The daily reality of sin, evil, and brokenness clearly contradict her claim.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Matter Is an Illusion</h4>
<ul>
<li>Claim: Disease, death, sin, and even the physical world are not truly real.</li>
<li>Quote:<blockquote>“There is no life, truth, intelligence, nor substance in matter.”
— Science and Health, p. 468</blockquote></li>
<p>Reality:</p>
<li>This is philosophical denialism—not biblical Christianity.</li>
<li>Matter is affirmed in Scripture (Genesis 1; Christ’s bodily resurrection in Luke 24).</li>
</ul>


<img class="post-image" src="Swedenborg.png">
<h2>Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772)</h2>

<p>Founder of the theology behind the New Church (also called Swedenborgianism).</p>
<p>Claimed to visit Heaven and Hell regularly</p>
<p>He conversed with angels, demons, and spirits — often daily</p>
<p>Taught that the Last Judgment occurred in 1757 — invisibly, in the spiritual world</p>

<h2>Swedenborg’s False Prophecies & Failed Predictions</h2>

<h4>The Last Judgment Happened in 1757 (Spiritually)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: Swedenborg taught that the Last Judgment, spoken of in Revelation, already occurred — in the spiritual realm, not visibly on Earth.</li>
  <li>Source: The Last Judgment (1758)</li>
  <li>Details: He said the spiritual world was cleansed of corrupt “Christian” spirits, making room for a new heavenly era on Earth.</li>
  <p>Reality:</p>
  <li>No such event happened in 1757 in either the physical or spiritual sense (according to Scripture or history).</li>
  <li>The true Last Judgment is still a future, global, physical event (Rev. 20:11–15).</li>
  <li>Biblical Conflict: Revelation’s judgment includes resurrection, casting into the lake of fire, and the visible return of Christ.</li>
</ul>

<h4>A New Church Would Replace Historic Christianity</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: Swedenborg predicted the complete rejection and collapse of traditional Christianity, to be replaced by his “New Church” — a spiritual movement aligned with his revelations.</li>
  <li>Source: True Christian Religion, §179, §753</li>
  <li>Details: He said the former church had spiritually died and the New Church would gradually emerge and triumph worldwide.</li>
  <p>Reality:</p>
  <li>250+ years later, Swedenborgianism is a fringe sect, with fewer than 20,000 members globally.</li>
  <li>Traditional Christianity continues to thrive in billions across denominations.</li>
</ul>


<h4>No Future Bodily Resurrection</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: He rejected the idea of a future resurrection of the body.
<blockquote>“Man rises again only as to his spirit... the body is cast off and never resumed.”
— Heaven and Hell, §445–451</blockquote>
</li>
<p>Reality:</p>
  <li>This denies the future, physical resurrection taught in 1 Corinthians 15, Daniel 12:2, and John 5:28–29.</li>
  <li>It also contradicts the bodily resurrection of Christ, which is the model for ours.</li>
 </ul>

<h4>The Church Had Been Dead Since 1757</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: He declared that the institutional Christian Church died spiritually in 1757, and that God ceased working through it.</li>
  <p>Problem:</p>
  <li>Since then, hundreds of millions have come to Christ, Scripture has been translated into almost every language, and countless churches have been planted.</li>
  <li>His “New Church” has remained tiny, obscure, and internally divided.</li>
</ul>


<img class="post-image" src="Crowdy.png">
<h2>William S. Crowdy (1847–1908)</h2>

<p>Founder of the Church of God and Saints of Christ</p>
<p>Born into slavery in Maryland in 1847</p>
<p>Became a Baptist preacher and later claimed to receive divine visions</p>

<h2>❌ False Prophecies & Failed Predictions of William S. Crowdy</h2>

<h4>Claimed to Be the Last Prophet of God</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: Crowdy declared he was the final prophet sent to restore true Israel and reveal God’s last message.</li>
  <li>Problem: No fulfilled, testable prophecies. His movement fragmented after his death and contradicted Scripture, which says:
    <blockquote>“In these last days [God] has spoken to us by His Son.” — Hebrews 1:1–2</blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>African Americans = Ethnic Israelites</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: Crowdy taught that African Americans are the physical descendants of the 12 tribes of Israel.</li>
  <p>Problem:</p>
  <li>Genetic studies refute this.</li>
  <li>Historical, linguistic, and migratory records show African Americans descended from West African peoples, not Hebrews.</li>
  <li>The New Covenant abolishes tribal distinctions (Gal. 3:28).</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Restoration of the Twelve Tribes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: Crowdy said he was gathering the lost tribes of Israel, beginning with Black Americans.</li>
  <p>Problem:</p>
  <li>No worldwide tribal restoration occurred.</li>
  <li>His organization splintered and lacks unity in doctrine and mission.</li>
  <li>The true regathering of Israel is fulfilled in Christ, not race (Isaiah 11:12; Eph. 2:14–16).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Old Covenant Practices Restored</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: Taught a return to Old Testament laws — Sabbaths, feast days, dietary restrictions, ritual purity.</li>
  <p>Problem:</p>
  <li>The book of Galatians condemns going back to the Law as a requirement for salvation (Gal. 5:4).</li>
  <li>Hebrews makes clear: Christ is the fulfillment of the Law (Heb. 10:1–10).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Jesus Was Not the Final Word</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Claim: Though Crowdy acknowledged Jesus, he claimed additional revelation was needed — namely, his own.</li>
  <p>Problem:</p>
  <li>This contradicts Hebrews 1:2, Revelation 22:18, and Jude 3 (the faith was “once for all delivered”).</li>
</ul>
