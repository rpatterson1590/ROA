      <h1>Family Tradition It’s more than a song by ol’ Bocephus—way more.</h1>

      <p>Family tradition is one of the quietest roads to hell because nobody talks about it. Plenty of people think they’re walking with God, but in reality, they’ve never taken that walk seriously. They’re running on secondhand faith, lacking knowledge and understanding, and ignoring clear instruction from Proverbs 3:5–6:</p>

      <blockquote>“Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.”</blockquote>

      <p>Now, Proverbs 3 covers a wide range of people, but let’s focus in. A lot of folks lean on their own understanding by leaning on Grandma’s understanding, or Daddy’s theology. But ask yourself: what’s the difference between a Muslim staying in their faith just because that’s how they were raised… and you doing the same? None.</p>

      <p>The same God who will judge them according to the light they were given will judge you even more strictly, because you've been given more. Jesus made this crystal clear in Luke 12:47–48:</p>

      <blockquote>“The servant who knew the master’s will and did not get ready or act according to his will, will receive a severe beating… But the one who did not know, and did what deserved a beating, will receive a light beating. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required…”</blockquote>

      <p>Bottom line: ignorance isn’t protection. If you have a Bible in your house, on your phone, or at your fingertips—and you never crack it open to weigh your beliefs by it—you’re without excuse.</p>

      <p>Paul told Timothy: <blockquote>“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.” (2 Timothy 2:15)</blockquote> And remember—Timothy didn’t have the complete Bible like you do. So what’s your excuse?</p>

      <p>And please, don’t hit me with that “I feel” stuff. That’s the weakest excuse since “It’s not my fault.”
       Mormons say they feel a “burning in the bosom” to confirm the Book of Mormon. So, does that make their book true?</p>

       <p>Saying “I feel it’s true” is just as dangerous as “God knows my heart.” Yeah—He does.Jeremiah 17:9 says:
<blockquote>“The heart is more deceitful than all else and desperately sick; who can understand it?”</blockquote></p>

<p>You’re living in a time where you can access, study, and test the Word of God at any moment. Yet most people never once examine their own beliefs.
Truth is, many can’t even give a solid reason for why they believe the Bible at all.
</p>

<p>That’s inherited religion. That’s spiritual laziness.
Hand-me-down faith might keep you in a pew, but it won’t stand in judgment. Truth must be known—not just passed along.
</p>

<p>1 Thessalonians 5:21 lays it out clearly: <blockquote>“Test everything; hold fast to what is good.”</blockquote></p>

<p>Look at the Bereans. They didn’t go off emotion. <blockquote>“Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.” (Acts 17:11)</blockquote></p>

<p>That’s what it looks like to fear God—not leaning on what Grandma believed.</p>

<p>Too many people wear Christianity like a family jersey—not a cross. But God has no grandchildren—only sons and daughters who truly know Him.</p>

<p>Don’t wait for Judgment Day to find out you never really knew the God you claimed to follow.</p>

<p>Test your faith now! If your beliefs can’t survive Scripture, they won’t survive eternity.</p>

<p>And if you trust the Bible as God’s Word—go back and read what the early Christians said about it.

</ul>

<p>
These weren’t heretics—they were the ones protecting the truth when the Church was still bleeding from Roman persecution.
</p>



<p>Not to replace Scripture, but to see how the earliest believers fought for and preserved it. If you believe the Holy Spirit guided the formation of Scripture, then it’s worth asking why we ignore the voices He used to protect it in the earliest centuries.</p>
